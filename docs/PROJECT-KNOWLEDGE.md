## 4. Deal Lifecycle (Pipeline Stages)

19 stages matching blueprint §9:

```
new_lead → appointment_set → appointment_sat → design_requested →
design_complete → proposal_sent → proposal_accepted → financing_applied →
financing_approved → stips_pending → stips_cleared → contract_sent →
contract_signed → submission_ready → submitted → intake_approved
                                                → intake_rejected
Also: cancelled, lost
```

**Stage categories:**

- Lead: new_lead, appointment_set, appointment_sat
- Design: design_requested, design_complete
- Proposal: proposal_sent, proposal_accepted
- Financing: financing_applied, financing_approved, stips_pending, stips_cleared
- Contract: contract_sent, contract_signed
- Submission: submission_ready, submitted, intake_approved, intake_rejected
- Closed: cancelled, lost

**Terminal stages:** intake_approved (deal moves to Quickbase), cancelled, lost
**Revivable:** lost → appointment_set (can revive lost deals)
**Backward allowed:** design_complete/proposal_sent → design_requested (redesign)

**Important:** KinOS pipeline ENDS at intake_approved. Everything after (install scheduling, permitting, inspection, PTO) lives in Quickbase. A future v2 "Installs" tab will provide read-only visibility into Quickbase install progress.

### App Routes

**Pages:**

- `/` — Dashboard (pipeline summary, appointments widget, activity feed, financing alerts)

---

## 5. Data Flow Architecture

### 5.1 Lead Intake (RepCard → KinOS)

**Trigger:** Rep manually clicks "Send to KinOS" button in RepCard Connectors.

**RepCard Connector Config:**

- Connector Type: Custom
- Type: Web
- Method: POST
- Title: "Send to KinOS"
- URL: `https://kin-os-one.vercel.app/api/webhooks/repcard/create-lead`

**Fields sent from RepCard:**

Contact Fields:

- customers.id (RepCard customer ID)
- customers.firstName, lastName, email, phoneNumber, fullPhoneNumber, countryCode
- customers.address, city, state, zip
- customers.type (Contact Type), statusId

User Fields:

- user.id, firstName, lastName, email, jobTitle

**KinOS webhook handler:**

1. Validates payload
2. Looks up or creates contact (match on repcard_customer_id or phone+email)
3. Looks up KinOS user by repcard_user_id
4. Creates deal at stage `new_lead`
5. Logs webhook event
6. Returns 200 OK

### 5.2 RepCard Webhook Routes (7 events — all wired)

The legacy `/api/webhooks/repcard` (create-lead) route now delegates to `/appointment-set`.

| Event                | Route                                        | Status   | Handler                                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| appointment_set      | `/api/webhooks/repcard/appointment-set`      | ✅ Wired | Creates contact + deal + appointment                |
| appointment_update   | `/api/webhooks/repcard/appointment-update`   | ✅ Wired | Updates appointment fields (time, location, closer) |
| appointment_outcome  | `/api/webhooks/repcard/appointment-outcome`  | ✅ Wired | Records outcome, updates appointment status         |
| closer_update        | `/api/webhooks/repcard/closer-update`        | ✅ Wired | Reassigns deal closer                               |
| status_changed       | `/api/webhooks/repcard/status-changed`       | ✅ Wired | Updates contact repcard_status                      |
| contact_type_changed | `/api/webhooks/repcard/contact-type-changed` | ✅ Wired | Updates contact type                                |
| door_knocked         | `/api/webhooks/repcard/door-knocked`         | ✅ Wired | Logs activity, creates/updates contact              |

### 5.3 User Sync (RepCard → KinOS)

RepCard is source of truth for users (reps). KinOS syncs via:

- RepCard GET /api/users/minimal (bulk sync)
- RepCard GET /api/users/{id}/details (individual)
- RepCard PUT /api/users/{id} (update, push KIN ID to externalId)

**RepCard API Auth:** Header `x-api-key: {api_key}`

### 5.4 Design Flow (KinOS → Aurora)

1. Closer enters consumption data (monthly bill, annual kWh)
2. Closer clicks "Request Design"
3. KinOS creates Aurora project via API (address, consumption profile)
4. Aurora designs system (async)
5. Aurora webhook fires `design_complete`
6. KinOS pulls design data (arrays, production, panel layout)
7. Closer builds proposal from design data

### 5.5 Proposal & Pricing Flow

1. Design data populates proposal (system size, panel count, production)
2. Pricing engine calculates: base PPW × system size + adders - discounts + dealer fee = gross price
3. Closer selects lender + product → financing terms applied
4. Federal rebate (ITC) calculated
5. Proposal finalized → snapshot taken → deal advances

### 5.6 Financing Flow

1. Closer selects lender and product on proposal
2. Financing application created and submitted to lender API
3. Status tracked: submitted → pending → approved/denied
4. Stips tracked as JSONB array
5. Welcome call / lender-specific gates checked

### 5.7 Document Signing Flow

1. Contract generated from PandaDoc/SignNow template
2. Merge fields populated from deal + proposal data
3. Sent to homeowner for signature
4. Webhook fires on signature events
5. Signed document URL stored

### 5.8 Submission Flow (KinOS → Quickbase)

1. All gates checked (utility bill uploaded, contract signed, financing cleared, etc.)
2. Deal data compiled (matches Enerflo's Quickbase payload structure)
3. Submitted to Quickbase
4. Snapshot taken at submission time
5. Intake team reviews in Quickbase
6. Approval/rejection flows back

## 7. Enerflo Payload Structure (Reference)

See enerflo-payload-analysis.md for full field-by-field comparison.
See schema-updates-from-enerflo.md for schema gaps identified and resolved.

Key: Enerflo's deal.projectSubmitted webhook structure is the template for Quickbase submission compatibility. All critical fields are mapped in the v1 schema.

## 10. Key Architecture Decisions

| Decision              | Resolution                                                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Next.js version       | 16 (App Router). Middleware renamed to proxy.ts.                            |
| Auth strategy         | Supabase Auth + RLS. No self-registration. Admin creates accounts.          |
| Client component data | API routes, NOT direct server action imports                                |
| RepCard lead flow     | Manual push via connector (not automatic webhook)                           |
| Pipeline scope        | KinOS ends at intake_approved. Install tracking = Quickbase.                |
| Aurora integration    | API + webhooks, no iframe. KinOS = pricing brain, Aurora = design layer.    |
| Equipment ownership   | Split: Aurora owns catalog, KinOS owns business logic/pricing               |
| Document signing      | PandaDoc primary, SignNow fallback                                          |
| Commission flow       | KinOS → Quickbase → Sequifi/CaptiveIQ (no direct push)                      |
| Launch strategy       | Full cutover from Enerflo. New deals in KinOS, old deals finish in Enerflo. |
| Pricing engine        | Typed TypeScript service with Big.js, not configurable function graph       |
| v2 Installs tab       | Read-only visibility into Quickbase install progress for closers            |

---

## 11. Open Items / Future Work
