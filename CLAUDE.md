# KinOS — Solar CRM for KIN Home

## What This Project Is

KinOS is an internal CRM replacing Enerflo for KIN Home's solar sales operations.
Built with Next.js 16 (App Router), Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS), deployed on Vercel.
Epics 0–10 are complete (Auth, RepCard, Pipeline, Leads, Calendar, Aurora Design, Proposal/Pricing, Financing, Document Signing + Notifications, Submission & Gating).

## Before You Start ANY Task

Read these docs before making changes — not just for "architectural decisions", but for ANY non-trivial work.
The goal: every agent understands what exists, what we're building toward, and how current work fits in.

**Understand the vision and future:**

- `/docs/kinos-vision-and-state.md` — What we're building, why, current state, architecture decisions, what's next
- `/docs/kinos-future-features.md` — Detailed explainers for ALL planned features with build constraints. READ BEFORE BUILDING — understand how your work impacts future features.

**Understand what exists today:**

- `/docs/PROJECT-KNOWLEDGE.md` — Master knowledge base: schema, migrations, API routes, epic status. **Single source of truth.**
- `/docs/db-audit.md` — Live database inventory with column summaries (51 tables + 2 views, verified 2026-02-12)
- `/docs/schema-reference.md` — Column-level schema from live DB (51 tables, 952 columns)

**Architecture reference:**

- `/docs/blueprint.md` — Full system architecture spec (reference, may lag behind actual state)

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 with App Router (NOT Pages Router). Middleware file is `proxy.ts` not `middleware.ts`.
- **Database:** Supabase (Postgres) with Row Level Security. 51 tables + 2 views live.
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (email/password). No self-registration. Admin creates accounts.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Package Manager:** pnpm
- **Deployment:** Vercel at kin-os-one.vercel.app (auto-deploys from main branch)

## Database Access Patterns

- **Browser/Client components:** Use `lib/supabase/client.ts` (anon key, respects RLS)
- **Server components/actions:** Use `lib/supabase/server.ts` (cookie-based auth, respects RLS)
- **Webhooks/API routes:** Use `lib/supabase/admin.ts` (service role, bypasses RLS)
- NEVER use the service role client in client components
- NEVER expose the service role key to the browser

## Pipeline Stages (19 stages — blueprint §9)

```
new_lead → appointment_set → appointment_sat → design_requested →
design_complete → proposal_sent → proposal_accepted → financing_applied →
financing_approved → stips_pending → stips_cleared → contract_sent →
contract_signed → submission_ready → submitted → intake_approved
                                                → intake_rejected
Also: cancelled, lost
```

Stage constants are in `lib/constants/pipeline.ts`. Do NOT add, remove, or rename stages without explicit instruction.

## Key Architecture Rules

- All data is company-isolated via RLS policies using `company_id`
- Soft deletes everywhere (`deleted_at` column, never hard delete)
- Major tables have `created_at`, `updated_at`, `updated_by`
- Deal stage transitions auto-logged by Postgres trigger to `deal_stage_history`
- Contact field changes auto-logged by Postgres trigger to `contact_change_history`
- Deal numbers auto-generate as `KIN-{YEAR}-{SEQ}` via Postgres trigger

## Code Conventions

- API routes go in `app/api/` — webhooks, CRUD endpoints
- Use server components by default, `"use client"` only when needed
- Error handling: always try/catch Supabase calls, return typed results
- No `any` types — use generated Supabase types from `lib/supabase/database.types.ts`
- Webhook handlers: always use `supabaseAdmin`, log to `webhook_events`, return 200 quickly

## Integrations Status

- **RepCard:** ✅ Complete — 7 webhook handlers, user sync, contact creation
- **Aurora Solar:** ✅ Complete — API client, service layer, webhooks, 3 design paths
- **Lender APIs:** 📋 Planned — 6 lenders with API access (GoodLeap, LightReach, Sunlight, Dividend, EnFin, Skylight)
- **Arrivy:** 📋 Planned — Site survey scheduling, field management, install visibility
- **Document Signing:** ✅ Manual tracking complete — ManualSigningProvider, PandaDoc adapter interface ready for Phase 2
- **Submission:** ✅ Complete — ManualSubmissionProvider, SubmissionPayload interface, deal_snapshots, gate engine (13 blueprint gates)
- **Quickbase:** 📋 Planned — QuickbaseSubmissionProvider implementation for actual push + post-sale bidirectional sync
- **Sequifi/CaptiveIQ:** 📋 Planned — Commission push on deal milestones
- **Twilio:** 📋 Planned — SMS/email notifications

## Build With the End in Mind

Before building any feature, read `docs/kinos-future-features.md` to understand how your work impacts planned features. Key principles:

- Every external integration uses an adapter pattern (swap providers without touching UI)
- Every deal state change should emit a notification event (even if notification system isn't built yet)
- Every admin-configurable value should have an audit trail (who changed what, when)
- Every new table needs RLS policies from day one
- Mobile-responsive layouts from the start — no desktop-only patterns

## POST-IMPLEMENTATION: Keep Everything In Sync

After completing ANY task that changes the system, you MUST update ALL affected files before committing.
Multiple files contain overlapping information. If you change something, update it EVERYWHERE it appears.

### Update As You Go — Not At The End

Do NOT batch doc updates for the end of a task. Update docs **immediately after each change** — after each migration, each new route, each new page. If you write a migration then move on to building the UI, update the schema docs BEFORE starting the UI work.

Why: context windows run out. If you save doc updates for last, they never happen, and the next agent starts with stale information. Treat doc updates as part of the implementation step, not a separate cleanup phase.

If you are running low on context and cannot finish the full task, **prioritize doc updates for work already completed** over starting new code. Incomplete code can be continued by the next agent — but only if the docs reflect what was actually built.

### Rules

- Update `Last updated` dates on any doc you touch
- Commit doc updates in the SAME commit as the code changes (or immediately after if the change is already committed)
- If you're unsure whether a file needs updating, read it and check
- The goal: the NEXT agent that reads these files gets accurate information
